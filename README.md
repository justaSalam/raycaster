Thanks for downloading this "terrible" raycaster

This was made in around 12 hours and even tho It was a major headache, I still enjoyed working on this.
I am totally avare of the fact that the code is painful to look at but It works so Im never touching it again :D
There is some stuff that might be hard to understand what it does so I added some comments to hopefully help someone out.

You are free to modify and even use it for your game/s (not sure why anyone would do that)!
